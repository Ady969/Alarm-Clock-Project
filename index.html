            <b>Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering</b>
            in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a
            senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of
            progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project
            was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,
            impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under
            stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly
            missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
            ninth in qualifuliers, and only eight positions were available in
            the IAF.[24]
